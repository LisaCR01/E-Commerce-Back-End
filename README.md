# E-Commerce Back End
In this project I built the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. The motivation for me to create this application is because of the prevalence of e-commerce sites such as Shopify. The prevalence of these sites means that understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit me as a full-stack web developer. I built this project to explore new concepts: the use of association methods, RESTful CRUD Operations and the use of sequelize. An issue in my application is that when used in insomnia certain fields do not populate e.g. price.

## Technologies Used
* MySQL2 package
* Node.js
* JavaScript
* Express.js 
* JSON
* Sequelize package
* dotenv package

## Criteria that I Met to Achieve this
* When the user adds their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
* When the user enters schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
* When the user enters the command to invoke the application, then their server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
* When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
* When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
