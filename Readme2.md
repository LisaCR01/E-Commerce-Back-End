# Employee Management System


## Technologies Used
* MySQL2 package
* Inquirer package
* Node.js
* JavaScript
* Express.js 
* JSON
* Sequelize package
* dotenv package

## Criteria that I Met to Achieve this
* When the user adds their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
* When the user enters schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
* When the user enters the command to invoke the application, then their server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
* When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
* When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
